        cottageByTheSea: `This spacious, unparalleled cave house, hanging on the cliffs of the caldera in the center of Oia, is part of a traditional complex of cave houses, owned & renovated by a family of architects.
        
        The space
        Crowning a unique complex of cave houses which used to serve as the old bakery of the settlement, and just a moment from the main pedestrian street of Oia, lays the remarkable cave house of sculptural aesthetics.
        
        Originally renovated for personal use by local craftsmen, the house perfectly combines traditional style with comfort. The plasticity of its forms, the use of local techniques, the built in beds and the selection of antique furniture together with the modern amenities, strike the right balance between sophistication and coziness.
        
        The cave house has two private bedrooms one of which was actually the old cistern, now transformed into a cocoon, cave room. This couples' nest, is five organic-formed steps sideways and below the main level of the house, with an emperor size (200 x 200 cm) built in bed and vintage wooden furniture.
        The original path that was naturally created by the cliff structure, connecting the two caves which form this house, leads to the master bedroom, on the other side of the house, maintaining the original architectural plan. With a private entrance, two windows and a door that separates it from the rest of the house, this bright and spacious bed room comfortably fits an oak queen size bed (160 x 200 cm), a large desk with a chair, an antique bookcase and a handcrafted mirror.
        Both bedrooms are equipped with high quality latex mattresses.

        In the commodious, off-white living room, a warm and relaxing corner has been created by the two large built in sofa beds (easily accommodating two for sleep) and the square beech wood coffee table. On the side, a solid, oak wood dining table is surrounded be a wooden and a built in bench, comfortably sitting a company of six for a luscious meal, right next to the fully equipped kitchen. There, an oven, ceramic hot plates, refrigerator, coffee machine, electric kettle, toaster and cutlery ensure your stay will be as convenient as possible.

        The bathroom, deeply curved in the cave, with off white local stucco technique and marble from Crete, has a handcrafted marble wash basin and rain shower.

        Outdoors, the private terraces expand on different levels literally on the rim of the caldera, creating unique angles and comfortable sitting spaces. You have travelled miles in order to come here; this is the time that you can finally dip in the white washed, semi cave whirlpool. Grasp the serenity and beauty of the sensational, unobstructed view of the volcano. The caldera, the sea and the sky which will undoubtedly leave you breathless. Enjoy!
        Guest access
        All the spaces of the house indoors and the outdoor terraces, expanding in two levels, are accessible to the guests.`,
        
        rentACastle: `Balintore Castle has been hosting guests since 1860. Located in a remote Highland Glen, it offers direct access to hill walking, mountain biking, bird-watching and shooting. The kitchen wing accommodation has recently been restored in keeping with the high Victorian character of the building. Full self-catering facilities are available.
        The space
        The holiday accommodation is located in the kitchen wing of the castle. This is the first area that has been brought to full habitability in the initial phase of a restoration program that started in 2007. Accommodation costs will be entirely directed towards further restoration of the castle.
        Guest access
        Guests have full and exclusive access to the kitchen wing, but are not allowed in the remainder of the castle which is undergoing restoration and is dangerous. When available, the owner, housekeeper or builder will be delighted be to show you around the whole building.
        
        Note, there is one other private property in the vicinity of the castle. This is the estate gamekeeper's cottage immediately facing the front of the castle. Please respect my neighbours' privacy and do not enter their grounds, and do not visit the dogs in their kennels. As a dog lover myself, I can understand the temptation to say hello, but these are working animals and will be upset by any approach.
        Other things to note
        You are welcome to bring in external catering If you wish e.g. via the "La Belle Assiette" and "Dine Indulge" portal website which allows you to contact local chefs. Professional catering facilities are available, and of course you can also self-cater.
        Chloe is a local chef who is happy to cater by prior arrangement. Please ask for contact information.
        
        Note that the heating may be off during the summer and periods of warm weather. We appreciate that guests come from all over the world, and may be used to a different climate, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you would like the heating switched on out of season.
        
        Extra beds can be supplied on request.
        
        Spare toilet rolls may be found in the bathroom cabinet.I
        
        The castle can be easily found: just enter the postcode DD8 5JS into a SATNAV. The last few miles of your drive will be on single track road, so please take care and reduce your speed on blind bends. Do not use the east drive (through the gate lodges) to approach the castle as the track is very rough. Instead, use the west drive which starts by a large barn, and has a "Balintore Castle" sign.
        
        If you are expecting the perfection of an luxury international hotel chain, then Balintore Castle is not for you! However, if you want a more characterful and "crumbly round the edges" experience and to be the house guests of a Highland Laird in a traditional Scottish Castle which once teetered on the brink of dereliction and is still actively being restored, then you will be made very welcome.
