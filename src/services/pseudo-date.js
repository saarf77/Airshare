               His house is a great place to stay, always clean and very organized. You just need to follow the few easy rules and enjoy the beautifully renovated flat.
               The 2 rooms he is renting have a lot of space, a big TV with access to Netflix, a very good queensize bed with really cosy sheets, a good climate machine and a roof ventilation too.
               Walking to the beach (20 minutes if you are a quick walker) is always a nice experience, cause the appartement is right next to the amazing Levinsky Market and Florentine.
               All in all the level of cost and quality and Yarons way of hosting guests is definitely worth 5*****!!!! Thanks for the amazing stay!!! With love from Vienna, Barbara`,

               His house is a great place to stay, always clean and very organized. You just need to follow the few easy rules and enjoy the beautifully renovated flat.
               The 2 rooms he is renting have a lot of space, a big TV with access to Netflix, a very good queensize bed with really cosy sheets, a good climate machine and a roof ventilation too.
               Walking to the beach (20 minutes if you are a quick walker) is always a nice experience, cause the appartement is right next to the amazing Levinsky Market and Florentine.
               All in all the level of cost and quality and Yarons way of hosting guests is definitely worth 5*****!!!! Thanks for the amazing stay!!! With love from Vienna, Barbara`,

               We had lots of snow during our stay, and the road was cleared well, parking was close (5 min walk) from the cabin. Would recommend a 4x4 in winter.
               
               The cabin is cozy, has a nice kitchen, very effective heating and good lighting throughout. We had a great stay, spent the days outside playing in the snow, seeing and reading books in front of the fireplace. Water is easily available outside the cabin, and can be poured into a water system inside (we didn't bother using it).
               
               All in all a great weekend, and we will definitely come back sometime!`,
